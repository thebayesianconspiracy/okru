# okru

This is a Measure What Matters meets Elephant In The Brain meets Atomic Habits effort to use personal OKRs that track System Metrics and positively decieve our silly brains. You can set your quarterly OKRs, pre-commit metrics, estimate possible failure modes and follow your friends.


What is this?
Okru in its earlier form was live at okru.app and it has lived its life but we believe a new okru needs to be reborn from the principles with greater product features and more community driven. So this repo serves that purpose.
